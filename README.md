JavaScript Quiz App

The JavaScript Quiz App is an interactive web application designed to test users' knowledge on various topics. It provides a dynamic, user-friendly interface where users can answer multiple-choice questions, receive feedback on their responses, and view their scores at the end. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase the power of client-side web development.

Features:
Multiple Choice Questions: Users are presented with multiple-choice questions, and they must select the correct answer.
Score Calculation: At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed based on correct answers.
Interactive UI: The application includes responsive design elements, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices.
Error Handling: Proper checks for user inputs, preventing invalid responses and ensuring a smooth quiz experience.
Tech Stack
HTML: Used to structure the content of the quiz app, including the questions, options, and results section.
CSS: Applied to style the layout, making the app visually appealing. It includes responsive design features to adapt to different screen sizes.
JavaScript: The main logic behind the app, handling the interactivity, managing the quiz flow, and performing real-time operations like checking answers, updating scores, and controlling the timer.
Concepts and Features Implemented
1. HTML
Structuring the page with essential elements such as div, button, and input tags to hold questions, options, and result data.
Displaying dynamic content (questions and answers) based on user interaction.
2. CSS
Implementing responsive design to ensure the app is usable on different screen sizes.
Using Flexbox or Grid layouts to align elements neatly.
Styling buttons, input fields, and text to make the app visually appealing.
3. JavaScript
Loops: Used for iterating through the list of questions and displaying them one by one. Loops help manage the questions' flow, ensuring that the quiz progresses properly.
Functions: Encapsulating logic into reusable functions. For example, there are functions for checking answers, displaying questions, updating the score, and controlling the timer.
Events: Event listeners are used to detect user interaction with the quiz, such as when a user selects an answer or clicks the "Next" button.
Objects: JavaScript objects are used to store each question and its associated options, the correct answer, and the user's response. This helps in organizing the quiz data efficiently.
Arrays: Arrays hold the list of questions and answers. These arrays are iterated over using loops to dynamically generate quiz content.
Logic: Core logic is implemented to track user selections, calculate scores, and navigate through the quiz questions.
